    "# 📊 Overview of Databricks SQL (DBSQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks SQL is a powerful environment for data analysis, querying, and visualization. It enables analysts, engineers, and business users to interact with data using SQL and build dashboards for insights and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 👤 Switching to SQL Persona\n",
    "\n",
    "To access Databricks SQL features, users must switch to the **SQL persona** in the workspace. This persona provides access to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQL Editor** – Write and execute SQL queries.\n",
    "- **Queries** – Manage saved and scheduled queries.\n",
    "- **Dashboards** – Create visual reports and interactive views.\n",
    "- **Alerts** – Set up conditional notifications based on query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ SQL Warehouses\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Warehouses are the **compute resources** that power SQL queries in Databricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Creating a SQL Warehouse\n",
    "- Users are guided through the creation of a SQL warehouse (e.g., \"Demo Warehouse\").\n",
    "- Configuration settings are reviewed, including scaling options and auto-stop settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Creating a Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "A hands-on demonstration walks through importing a sample dataset (e.g., NYC taxi trips) and visualizing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Dashboard Features:\n",
    "- Refresh dashboard data on demand.\n",
    "- View the underlying SQL for each visualization.\n",
    "- Understand table sources using the three-tier namespace: `catalog.schema.table`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 Modifying Visualizations:\n",
    "- Edit existing visuals.\n",
    "- Add new visual types such as pie charts or bar graphs.\n",
    "- Customize filters and parameters to refine insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤝 Sharing Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dashboards can be shared with collaborators across your organization.\n",
    "- Permissions can be configured to control **view** or **edit** access for other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✍️ Writing Custom SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔌 Connecting to SQL Warehouse:\n",
    "- Users connect to their created warehouse and choose a database for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 Exploring and Querying Data:\n",
    "- Preview table schemas to understand available columns.\n",
    "- Use standard SQL syntax, including:\n",
    "  - `GROUP BY`\n",
    "  - Aggregation functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💾 Saving Queries:\n",
    "- Save frequently used queries.\n",
    "- Pin query results directly to dashboards for dynamic visual updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Scheduling Refreshes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Queries and dashboards can be configured to **auto-refresh** on a schedule.\n",
    "- Ensures up-to-date data is always available for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚨 Setting Up Alerts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alerts can be triggered based on conditions from saved queries.\n",
    "- Email or workspace notifications keep users informed when data meets specified thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This session provides a full overview of Databricks SQL — from creating warehouses to building dashboards and setting alerts.  \n",
    "Users gain practical skills to analyze data, create visuals, and share insights effectively, all within a powerful, SQL-first environment.\n"
