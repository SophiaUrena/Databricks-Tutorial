    "# üß© Overview of Job Orchestration in Databricks\n",
    "\n",
    "Job orchestration in Databricks enables the automation of workflows by chaining together notebooks, pipelines, and other tasks. This session focuses on building a **multi-task job** to execute a data ingestion and processing pipeline using Delta Live Tables (DLT).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Steps for Creating a Job\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Creating a New Job\n",
    "- Navigate to the **Workflows** tab in the Databricks UI.\n",
    "- Click **\"Create Job\"** to begin the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß± Defining Tasks\n",
    "A typical multi-task job may include:\n",
    "1. **Load Data Notebook** ‚Äì Ingest raw files into the source directory.\n",
    "2. **Run DLT Pipeline** ‚Äì Execute the Delta Live Tables pipeline for transformation.\n",
    "3. **Display Results** ‚Äì Optionally run a notebook to visualize or verify outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîó Configuring Each Task\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Setting Task Dependencies\n",
    "- Ensure tasks run in the correct order by defining dependencies.\n",
    "- For example, the DLT pipeline should only begin after the data load task is successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è Task Setup\n",
    "- Choose the appropriate **task type** (notebook, DLT pipeline, etc.).\n",
    "- Specify notebook paths, parameters, and cluster configurations as needed.\n",
    "- Proper configuration ensures smooth handoff between steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚è±Ô∏è Scheduling and Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚è≤Ô∏è Job Scheduling\n",
    "- Jobs can be scheduled using **cron expressions** or time-based triggers.\n",
    "- The demo focuses on manual runs, but the system supports advanced scheduling options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìß Email Notifications\n",
    "- Enable notifications for job completion, failures, or status updates.\n",
    "- This helps keep stakeholders informed in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Monitoring Progress\n",
    "- Track job execution live in the **Jobs UI**.\n",
    "- Monitor task status, logs, execution time, and output in a visual interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ùå Error Handling and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Identifying Issues\n",
    "- Errors such as syntax problems in notebooks are surfaced in job logs.\n",
    "- The interface clearly marks failed tasks and provides troubleshooting info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ôªÔ∏è Repair Run\n",
    "- Use the **\"Repair Run\"** feature to rerun only failed tasks.\n",
    "- This improves efficiency by avoiding a full pipeline re-execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure **task dependencies** are clearly defined to maintain execution order.\n",
    "- Use **separate clusters** when needed to optimize resource usage.\n",
    "- After the job completes, **terminate pipeline clusters** to free up compute resources.\n",
    "- Configure **alerts and notifications** to stay updated on pipeline health.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Databricks Workflows for orchestration, teams can automate ETL pipelines, integrate multiple notebooks, and scale data processing efficiently with built-in error handling and monitoring tools.\n"
