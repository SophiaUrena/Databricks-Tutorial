    "# 🔄 Change Data Capture (CDC) in Delta Live Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Definition of CDC\n",
    "\n",
    "**Change Data Capture (CDC)** is a method used to detect and track changes—such as inserts, updates, and deletions—in a source system and apply them to a target system. It enables efficient data synchronization and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Why CDC Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "CDC plays a critical role in modern data pipelines by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keeping target systems in sync with source data.\n",
    "- Transferring only changed data, reducing overhead.\n",
    "- Boosting performance by eliminating full table scans and reloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Capturing Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Changes:\n",
    "- **Inserts** – New records added.\n",
    "- **Updates** – Modifications to existing records.\n",
    "- **Deletes** – Removed records must be deleted from the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each CDC event typically includes:\n",
    "- The changed data.\n",
    "- Metadata specifying the type of operation (insert/update/delete).\n",
    "- A timestamp or version to track the order of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📬 Receiving CDC Feeds\n",
    "\n",
    "CDC feeds may arrive in the form of:\n",
    "- **Data streams**\n",
    "- **JSON files**\n",
    "- **Events from messaging systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly handling these feeds ensures accurate and up-to-date replication in the target system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Implementing CDC in Delta Live Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 `APPLY CHANGES INTO` Command\n",
    "\n",
    "A specialized DLT command that simplifies the application of CDC feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defines a **target table** and **source table** (CDC feed).\n",
    "- Uses **primary keys** to identify unique records.\n",
    "- Applies the correct operation:\n",
    "  - Inserts new records.\n",
    "  - Updates existing ones.\n",
    "  - Deletes when specified using `applyAsDeleteWhen`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏳ Importance of Sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensures **late-arriving records** are handled correctly.\n",
    "- Maintains **data integrity** by applying changes in proper order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Features of `APPLY CHANGES INTO`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- **Automatic ordering** of records by version or timestamp.\n",
    "- Seamless **upsert operations** (insert/update).\n",
    "- Optional handling of **delete operations**.\n",
    "- Specify one or many fields as the  **primary key** for a table.\n",
    "- Specify columns to ignore with the **EXCEPT** keyword.\n",
    "- Support applying changes as SCD Type 1 (default) or SCD Type 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Breaks and append-only requirements for streaming table sources.\n",
    "  - Can NOT perform streaming queries against the table\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂️ Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on **Type 1 SCD**, where updates overwrite existing records.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: When using `APPLY CHANGES INTO`, the resulting table cannot serve as a **streaming source** in downstream layers due to the append-only limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "CDC enables efficient, real-time updates in Delta Live Tables.  \n",
    "By leveraging `APPLY CHANGES INTO`, users can build reliable pipelines that track and apply source system changes with minimal effort and maximum consistency.\n"
