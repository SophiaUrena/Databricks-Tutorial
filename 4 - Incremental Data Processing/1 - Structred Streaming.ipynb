    "# 🔄 Structured Streaming in Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📡 Understanding Data Streams\n",
    "Data streams represent continuously growing data sources such as:\n",
    "- New JSON log files\n",
    "- Change Data Capture (CDC) from databases\n",
    "- Event streams from systems like Kafka\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of processing the entire dataset repeatedly, modern streaming systems focus on **incremental processing**, handling only **new data** since the last update.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Spark Structured Streaming Overview\n",
    "Spark Structured Streaming is a powerful engine that treats data streams as **unbounded tables**.  \n",
    "You write queries on streaming data just like static tables — new records simply appear as new rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💧 Delta Lake Integration\n",
    "Delta Lake integrates seamlessly with Structured Streaming, allowing for efficient real-time ingestion and query capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `spark.readStream()` to read from Delta tables.\n",
    "- Write streaming results using `dataframe.writeStream()` with various configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Configuring Streaming Writes\n",
    "\n",
    "Key configurations for writing data streams include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trigger Intervals** – Controls how often Spark processes new data.\n",
    "- **Checkpointing** – Ensures fault tolerance by tracking the state and progress of a stream, allowing recovery in case of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏱️ Trigger Options\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Micro-Batch Mode** – Processes data in small time-based intervals.\n",
    "- **One-Time Batch Mode** – Executes a single batch to process available data.\n",
    "Each mode suits different latency and throughput requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📤 Output Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Append Mode** – Writes only newly arrived rows.\n",
    "- **Complete Mode** – Rewrites the full result every time data is processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice of mode depends on the use case and the type of transformation being applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Fault Tolerance & Guarantees\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Streaming offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exactly-once processing semantics** – Prevents duplicates or data loss.\n",
    "- **Checkpoints & Write-Ahead Logs** – Ensures resilience and recoverability of streaming jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Operations on Streaming DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Most transformations supported in static DataFrames are also supported in streaming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Joins\n",
    "- Filters\n",
    "- Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Some operations like **global sorting** and **deduplication** are **not supported** due to their complexity in unbounded contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⏳ Advanced Streaming Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Windowing** – Groups data into defined time windows for time-based analysis.\n",
    "- **Watermarking** – Handles **late-arriving data**, helping avoid processing outdated records indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Streaming enables **real-time analytics** on live data while offering the flexibility and expressiveness of traditional Spark SQL — making it ideal for modern, scalable, and fault-tolerant data pipelines.\n"
