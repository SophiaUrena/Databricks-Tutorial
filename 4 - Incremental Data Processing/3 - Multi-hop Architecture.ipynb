    "# üèóÔ∏è Multi-Hop Architecture (Medallion Architecture) Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Multi-Hop Architecture**, also known as the **Medallion Architecture**, is a layered design pattern commonly used in data engineering to incrementally refine data quality and structure as it moves through different stages of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is especially effective in **Lakehouse environments**, where structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üî∂ Bronze Layer ‚Äì Raw Ingestion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serves as the **landing zone** for raw, unprocessed data.\n",
    "- Sources may include JSON files, relational databases, Kafka streams, or REST APIs.\n",
    "- Data is captured **in its original form**, ensuring a reliable and immutable source of truth.\n",
    "- No transformations are applied at this stage; the focus is purely on ingestion and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üî∑ Silver Layer ‚Äì Data Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performs **cleansing, filtering, and joining** of data from the bronze layer.\n",
    "- Enhances data quality and consistency, often by combining or enriching datasets.\n",
    "- Transforms semi-structured data into a more usable tabular format.\n",
    "- Ideal for creating datasets that are **ready for analytical queries** and operational use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üü° Gold Layer ‚Äì Business-Level Curation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides **aggregated, curated, and business-consumable datasets**.\n",
    "- Optimized for use in BI tools, dashboards, reporting systems, and machine learning models.\n",
    "- Delivers **clean, consistent, and performance-tuned** data for decision-makers.\n",
    "- Represents the most refined version of the data pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Benefits of Multi-Hop Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple and Modular Design**: Easy to understand, implement, and scale.\n",
    "- **Incremental ETL**: Allows data to be processed in stages, reducing load and improving performance.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Workload Support**: Seamlessly handles both streaming and batch processing within the same pipeline.\n",
    "- **Table Recreation Flexibility**: Tables can be recreated from raw data when schemas change or corrections are needed.\n",
    "- **Data Lineage and Auditability**: Each layer provides traceable steps that improve data governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìå Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multi-Hop (Medallion) Architecture provides a **systematic and scalable approach** to organizing and refining data from raw ingestion to business-ready outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By structuring data into **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**, organizations gain clarity, flexibility, and reliability across their data pipelines‚Äîmaking it a key framework in modern Lakehouse designs.\n"
