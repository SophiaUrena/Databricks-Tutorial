    "# 🔐 Data Object Privileges in Databricks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛡️ Introduction to the Data Governance Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks implements a **fine-grained data governance model** that allows administrators and users to control access to various data objects. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Databases (Schemas)**\n",
    "- **Tables** (Managed and External)\n",
    "- **SQL Views**\n",
    "- **Named Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "This model ensures secure and role-based access throughout the data platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Granting, Revoking, and Denying Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to data objects can be programmatically controlled using SQL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GRANT** – Assign specific privileges to users or groups.\n",
    "- **REVOKE** – Remove previously granted privileges.\n",
    "- **DENY** – Explicitly prevent access, even if access is otherwise inherited.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Data Objects with Configurable Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Permissions can be configured for the following object types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Catalogs**\n",
    "- **Schemas (Databases)**\n",
    "- **Tables**\n",
    "- **SQL Views**\n",
    "- **Named Functions**\n",
    "- **ANY FILE** – For accessing files directly from the underlying storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Privileges Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key privileges that can be assigned to data objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT** – Read access to the data.\n",
    "- **MODIFY** – Insert, update, and delete operations on the data.\n",
    "- **CREATE** – Allows the creation of new objects within a container (e.g., tables in a schema).\n",
    "- **READ_METADATA** – Enables access to metadata like table schema or description.\n",
    "- **USAGE** – Required to interact with an object but grants no direct data access.\n",
    "- **ALL PRIVILEGES** – Grants all the above permissions for full access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 👥 Roles in Permission Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Different roles have the ability to manage access to objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Databricks Admins** – Can assign privileges across the workspace.\n",
    "- **Catalog Owners** – Control all objects in their catalog.\n",
    "- **Schema (Database) Owners** – Manage permissions within their specific schema.\n",
    "- **Table Owners** – Control access to their individual tables.\n",
    "- **Object Owners** – Grant privileges to their respective owned objects.\n",
    "- **Database Administrators** – Can also manage underlying storage permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Managing Object Privileges\n",
    "\n",
    "Common operations for permission management include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DENY / REVOKE** – Remove or restrict access when needed.\n",
    "- **SHOW GRANTS** – View the current privileges assigned to a user or object, useful for auditing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Practical Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "The session concludes with a **hands-on demo** in Databricks SQL, showing how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manage privileges for data objects.\n",
    "- Apply the governance concepts discussed.\n",
    "- Secure data access in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks’ role-based permission model provides a powerful and flexible way to **control who can see, modify, or manage data**, helping ensure compliance and data integrity across your organization.\n"
